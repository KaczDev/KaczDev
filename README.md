## Kacz

🌱 I'm Kacz (_like 'catch'_) _(he/him)_.

⚡ I like to code performant stuff (don't look at my AoC repo though).

I enjoy coding in anything that compiles and has errors as values, my two current favourites are:
- Rust 🦀
- Go 

I would like to start/code more in:
- Rust (+async) 🦀 
- Zig 🤔
- big Go projects

💼 I currently work as a Software Engineer @ Github!

_I have worked as a Site Reliability Engineer for 3 years.
I have worked on incidents, o11y platform and created tools to increase productivity or visibility._

🎲 My personal hobbies are
- Gaming (my favs are: The Witcher 3, Sekiro, Elden Ring)
- eSports (big fan of LoL games)
- Archery (started in autumn 2024, still a newbie)

👎 Dislikes _(added for funsies, no offence)_:
- JVM ☕
